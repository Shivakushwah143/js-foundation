Explanation of Key Concepts Covered:
Variables and Data Types:

Using let, const for defining variables.
Storing tasks in an array and using object properties like id, name, date, and isCompleted.
Conditionals:

Using if-else to check if the input is empty.
Using ternary operators for inline conditional styling in HTML (task.isCompleted ? 'line-through' : '').
Loops:

Using forEach() to iterate over the tasks array and display each task.
Functions:

Regular functions like displayTasks(), toggleComplete(), deleteTask(), and event handler functions.
Array Methods:

Using map(), filter(), and reduce() for various purposes (filter completed tasks, count tasks, etc.).
Example of filtering tasks based on search input.
Objects and Arrays:

Storing tasks as objects with properties.
Modifying objects directly.
JSON Methods:

Using JSON.stringify() to convert objects to JSON and JSON.parse() to convert JSON back to objects.
Date Methods:

Using the Date object to store the date and time when a task was created and displaying it with toLocaleDateString().
DOM Manipulation:

Selecting elements with getElementById(), creating new elements, and appending them to the DOM.
Handling dynamic user interactions (adding tasks, deleting tasks, filtering tasks).
Event Handling:

Adding event listeners for buttons (add task, clear tasks, filter input).
Error Handling:

Checking for empty input and showing an alert if needed.
Conclusion:
This project covers a wide range of JavaScript concepts and is perfect for an interview. It involves real-world application of arrays, functions, date objects, DOM manipulation, and error handling, making it a great exercise to understand key JavaScript topics.
